### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the Qubit-cube data to answer key questions, such as:
1.  Total Employees
2.  Marital Status of Employees
3.  Gender Differences 
4.  Attrition Rate
5.  Branches across Nigeria
6.  Attriton Count
7.  Total Current Employees
8.  Departments
9.  Sum of Monthly Income per branch
10. Sum of Current Employee per Departments in All States

### Data Analysis
Pivot table function was used to analyze the data to answer questions.

###  Results and Findings

---
1. #### Total Employees:
 Across all branches, the company has 150 total employees.

2. #### Marital Status:
 Married employees: 74, Single employees: 76. The split is nearly even, which may affect benefits preferences and attrition patterns.

3. #### Attrition Metrics
 Total attrition count: 53, Attrition rate: 35% – which is relatively high and may signal workforce instability.
Male attrition: 33, Female attrition: 20. Higher attrition among male staff suggests a need to review work-life balance, pay parity, or job satisfaction by gender.

4. #### Department Distribution:
Top departments by employee count:

Manager: 23,
Procurement: 20,
Receptionist: 21
Trainer: 19,
Human Resources: 14.

5. #### Current Gender Composition:
Male: 46 (47%)
Female: 51 (53%)
Fairly balanced gender representation, slightly favoring female staff.

6. #### Branch-Level Income:

#### Highest monthly incomes:

Lagos and Abuja: ₦3,120,000 each

Enugu: ₦2,300,000

Port Harcourt: ₦2,290,000

#### Lowest income branches:

Kaduna and Kanu: ₦1,360,000 each

#### Current Employee Count (Highlight):

Port Harcourt currently has 97 employees, which may be a reporting error (exceeds total of 150 employees unless it's an aggregation issue).

  ### Recommendations
  
1. Investigate High Attrition Rate (35%): Conduct exit interviews and satisfaction surveys to identify key drivers of attrition.
Consider stay interviews to proactively address concerns of current employees.

2. Develop Targeted Retention Strategies for Male Employees: Since male attrition is higher, investigate specific challenges affecting male staff (e.g., workload, role mismatch, mobility).

3. Redistribute Resources Across Branches: Lower-income branches like Kaduna and Kanu may need strategic attention in terms of business development, resource allocation, or workforce optimization.

4. Optimize Departmental Staffing: Human Resources has the lowest staff (14) while others like Managers (23) are higher. Assess whether HR is understaffed, potentially impacting hiring and compliance.

5. Standardize Income Contribution Targets: Use best-performing branches (Lagos, Abuja) as benchmarks to set income targets and performance incentives for lower-performing branches.

6. Ensure Data Accuracy: Investigate the Port Harcourt “97 employees” figure for validation. This may skew the overall data and lead to incorrect insights.

  ### Conclusion
The HR analysis for Qubits Cube Nigeria reveals a workforce with balanced gender and marital status distribution but facing a high attrition rate (35%), particularly among male staff. While major cities like Lagos and Abuja are leading in income generation, some branches underperform, and HR staffing levels may be insufficient.

By addressing attrition, realigning branch strategies, and optimizing departmental resources, Qubits Cube can significantly improve employee retention, branch productivity, and overall organizational efficiency.
